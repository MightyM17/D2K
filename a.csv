1,DS,Monica Rogati,"By definition all scientists are data scientists. In my opinion, they are half hacker, half analyst, they use data to build products and find insights. It’s Columbus meet Columbo―starry-eyed explorers and skeptical detectives."
2,DS,Jennifer Shin,"‘Possessed’ is probably the right word. I often tell people, ‘I don’t want to necessarily be a data scientist. You just kind of are a data scientist. You just can’t help but look at that data set and go, ‘I feel like I need to look deeper. I feel like that’s not the right fit.’"
3,DS,Bob Hayes,"I think of data science as more like a practice than a job. Think of the scientific method, where you have to have a problem statement, generate a hypothesis, collect data, analyze data and then communicate the results and take action…. If you just use the scientific method as a way to approach data-intensive projects, I think you’re more apt to be successful with your outcome."
4,DS,Bill Schmarzo,"As a data scientist, I can predict what is likely to happen, but I cannot explain why it is going to happen. I can predict when someone is likely to attrite, or respond to a promotion, or commit fraud, or pick the pink button over the blue button, but I cannot tell you why that’s going to happen. And I believe that the inability to explain why something is going to happen is why I struggle to call ‘data science’ a science."
5,DS,John Foreman,"Data scientists are kind of like the new Renaissance folks, because data science is inherently multidisciplinary."
6,DS,Josh Wills,Data Scientist (n.): Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.
7,DS,Daniel Tunkelang,"As data scientists, our job is to extract signal from noise."
8,DS,Hilary Mason,"The job of the data scientist is to ask the right questions. If I ask a question like ‘how many clicks did this link get?’ which is something we look at all the time, that’s not a data science question. It’s an analytics question. If I ask a question like, ‘based on the previous history of links on this publisher’s site, can I predict how many people from France will read this in the next three hours?’ that’s more of a data science question."
9,DS,Chris Pehura,"A data scientist does model-driven analyses of our data; analyzes to improve our planning, increase our productivity, and develop our deeper levels of subject matter expertise. A data scientist works at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels, sharing insights with the business."
10,DS,Peter Skomoroch,"[Data scientists are] able to think of ways to use data to solve problems that otherwise would have been unsolved, or solved using only intuition."
11,DS,Carla Gentry,"What sort of personality makes for an effective data scientist? Definitely curiosity…. The biggest question in data science is ‘Why?’ Why is this happening? If you notice that there’s a pattern, ask, Why? Is there something wrong with the data or is this an actual pattern going on? Can we conclude anything from this pattern? A natural curiosity will definitely give you a good foundation."
12,DS,Brendan Tierney,"There is a saying, ‘A jack of all trades and a master of none.’ When it comes to being a data scientist you need to be a bit like this, but perhaps a better saying would be, ‘A jack of all trades and a master of some.’"
13,DS,Dr. Kirk Borne,"My number one piece of advice always is to follow your passions first. Know what you are good at and what you care about, and pursue that…. As a successful data scientist, your day can begin and end with you counting your blessings that you are living your dream by solving real-world problems with data."
14,DS,DJ Patil,The No. 1 thing is you’ve got to have passion. This rich passion for going ruthlessly after the problem and being deeply intellectually honest with yourself about whether this is a reasonable answer….
15,DS,Vik Paruchuri,"Nobody ever talks about motivation in learning. Data science is a broad and fuzzy field, which makes it hard to learn. Really hard. Without motivation, you’ll end up stopping halfway through and believing you can’t do it, when the fault isn’t with you―it’s with the teaching."
16,DS,"Shelly D. Farnham, Ph.D.","I do not know how you teach someone to love to learn, but being self-motivated is integral to this field. Once you have the core concepts, to be able to be really excited about, and continue to seek out, new information is something that I look for, for example, when we are recruiting people."
17,DS,Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro,"You can best learn data mining and data science by doing, so start analyzing data as soon as you can! However, don’t forget to learn the theory, since you need a good statistical and machine learning foundation to understand what you are doing and to find real nuggets of value in the noise of big data."
18,DS,Claudia Perlich,Learning how to do data science is like learning to ski. You have to do it.
19,DS,James Kobielus,"Data science’s learning curve is formidable. To a great degree, you will need a degree, or something substantially like it, to prove you’re committed to this career…."
20,DS,Devavrat Shah,"In my view, success for data science professionals relies on becoming trained and able data scientists with the ability to perform data processing and computation at a massive scale. To achieve this, professionals must invest time in ongoing education through institutions with multidisciplinary programs that include elements from engineering, mathematical sciences, and social sciences. Converting big data into meaningful information begins with skilled professionals who are educated in all disciplines to be both data scientists and statisticians."
21,DS,Lutz Finger,There is no bottleneck for data scientists… The bottleneck is very often for companies who don’t have a culture of working with data to actually cut down the process into the right steps.
22,DS,Stephan Kolassa,"Once you have a certain amount of math/stats and hacking skills, it is much better to acquire a grounding in one or more subjects than in adding yet another programming language to your hacking skills, or yet another machine learning algorithm to your math/stats portfolio…. Clients will rather work with some data scientist A who understands their specific field than with another data scientist B who first needs to learn the basics―even if B is better in math/stats/hacking."
23,DS,Jean-Paul Isson,"Being a data scientist is not only about data crunching. It’s about understanding the business challenge, creating some valuable actionable insights to the data, and communicating their findings to the business."
24,DS,Martyn Jones,"Without a grounding in statistics, a Data Scientist is a Data Lab Assistant."
25,DS,Bill Franks,"Having skills in statistics, math, and programming is certainly necessary to be a great analytic professional, but they are not sufficient to make a person a great analytic professional."
26,DS,Vincent Granville,Talented data scientists leverage data that everybody sees; visionary data scientists leverage data that nobody sees.
27,DS,Monica Rogati,"What makes a good scientist great is creativity with data, skepticism and good communication skills. Getting all of that together in the same person is difficult―because traditionally, different people follow different paths in their careers―some are more technical, others are more creative and communicative. A data scientist has to have both."
28,DS,Drew Conway,"Good data science is exactly the same [as] good science…. Good data science will never be measured by the terabytes in your Cassandra database, the number of EC2 nodes your jobs is using, or the volume of mappers you can send through a Hadoop instance. Having a lot of data does not license you to have a lot to say about it."
29,DS,Jake Porway,"Critical thinking skills…really [set] apart the hackers from the true scientists, for me…. You must must MUST be able to question every step of your process and every number that you come up with."
30,DS,Cathy O’Neil,"How do we start to regulate the mathematical models that run more and more of our lives? I would suggest that the process begin with the modelers themselves. Like doctors, data scientists should pledge a Hippocratic Oath, one that focuses on the possible misuses and misinterpretations of their models."
31,DS,Douglas Merrill,"With too little data, you won’t be able to make any conclusions that you trust. With loads of data you will find relationships that aren’t real… Big data isn’t about bits, it’s about talent."
32,DS,Mike Driscoll,"Data analysts who don’t organize their transformation pipelines often end up not being able to repeat their analyses, so the advice I would give to myself is the same advice often given to traditional scientists: make your experiments repeatable!"
33,DS,KarolisUrbonas,"Great data scientists never assume they know something without in-depth analysis, they think in hypotheses which need to be either rejected or proved, and they ask a lot of questions, even if they are 99.9% sure they know the answer."
34,DS,Edwin Chen,"For me, data science is a mix of three things: quantitative analysis (for the rigor necessary to understand your data), programming (so that you can process your data and act on your insights), and storytelling (to help others understand what the data means)."
35,DS,"Thomas C. Redman, Ph.D.",The difference between a great [data scientist] and a good one is like the difference between lightning and a lightning bug.
36,DS,Nate Silver,"The numbers have no way of speaking for themselves. We speak for them. We imbue them with meaning…. Data-driven predictions can succeed―and they can fail. It is when we deny our role in the process that the odds of failure rise. Before we demand more of our data, we need to demand more of ourselves."
37,DS,Victor Hu,"One of the big challenges of being a data scientist that people might not usually think about – is that the results or the insights you come up with have to make sense and be convincing. The more intelligible you can make them, the more likely it is that your recommendations will be put into effect."
38,DS,Alexander Linden,"A data scientist must possess the knack of being able to ‘identify business value from mathematical models.’ But that vital business value can only materialize if the data scientist also networks with other departments, understands their objectives, is familiar with their data and processes – and can spot the analysis options they provide."
39,DS,YanirSeroussi,"People like simple explanations for complex phenomena. If you work as a data scientist, or if you are planning to become/hire one, you’ve probably seen storytelling listed as one of the key skills that data scientists should have. Unlike ‘real’ scientists that work in academia and have to explain their results mostly to peers who can handle technical complexities, data scientists in industry have to deal with non-technical stakeholders who want to understand how the models work. However, these stakeholders rarely have the time or patience to understand how things truly work. What they want is a simple hand-wavy explanation to make them feel as if they understand the matter―they want a story, not a technical report."
40,DS,Amy Heineike,"You need to be able to take a dataset and discover and communicate what’s interesting about it for your users. To turn this into a product requires understanding how to turn one-off analysis into something reliable enough to run day after day, even as the data evolves and grows, and as different users experience different aspects of it."
41,DS,Foster Provost,"We should expect a ‘Big Data 2.0’ phase to follow ‘Big Data 1.0’. Once firms have become capable of processing massive data in a flexible fashion, they should begin asking: ‘What can I do that I couldn’t do before, or do better than I could do before?’ This is likely to be the golden era of data science."
42,DS,Tom Fawcett,"As the field grows, keep an open mind and evolve with it. Work hard, think outside the box, and learn as much as you can about the technical side of being a data scientist. Be responsible with the data and realize the potential the data can have to solving problems. Always ask yourself how the data can be used to positively impact the lives around you, and use that to guide your design and development."
43,DS,ShanjiXiong,"Data science is not easy. Seems obvious enough, but as you encounter step-by-step career paths online, be aware that no single method is going to work for everyone, and the multiplicity of opinions on how to become a data scientist confirms that."
44,DA,"Alex Shultz, VP Analytics and CMO for Facebook","Different verticals need different terminal retention rates for them to have successful businesses. If you’re on e-commerce and you’re retaining on a monthly active basis, like 20 to 30% of your users, you’re going to do very well. If you’re on social media, and the first batch of people signing up to your product are not like, 80% retained, you’re not going to have a massive social media site. [...] What you need to do is have the tools to think, ‘who out there is comparable’ and how you can look at it and say, ‘am I anywhere close to what real success looks like in this vertical?’ "
45,DA,"Stuart McDonald, Consultant, formerly CMO at Freshbooks","Tracking marketing is a cultural thing. Either tracking matters or it doesn’t. You’re in one camp or the other. Either you’re analytical and data-driven, or you go by what you think works. People who go by gut are wrong."
46,DA,"Matt Trifiro, CMO at Vapor IO","Time and money are your scarcest resources. You want to make sure you’re allocating them in the highest-impact areas. Data reveals impact, and with data, you can bring more science to your decisions."
47,DA,"Andrew Chen, Partner at Andreessen Horowitz, formerly Head of Rider Growth at Uber","Have a vision for what you are trying to do. Use data to validate and help you navigate that vision, and map it down into small enough pieces where you can begin to execute in a data-informed way. Don’t let shallow analysis of data that happens to be cheap/easy/fast to collect nudge you off-course in your entrepreneurial pursuits."
48,DA,"Meenal Balar, Consultant, formerly Director of Emerging Market Growth at Facebook, and VP of Marketing at Remind","Execution is so critical. Sometimes you just need to try something, see what works and move forward."
49,DA,"John Egan, Head of Growth Engineer at Pinterest","When we initially started testing email subject lines, we defined the success criteria as driving an email open. This seemed to be the most straightforward since the Pinner reads the email subject line and the next action is to either open it or don’t. What we found, however, was that defining success with metrics that were further downstream (i.e. clicking on the content in the email) was more effective."
50,DA,"Kevin Li, Co-founder at Farmstead, formerly Head of Yahoo Growth","If there’s one takeaway it’s that it’s okay to do small wins. Small wins are good, they will compound. If you’re doing it right the end result will be massive."
51,DA,"Andrew Caplan, Head of Growth at Postscript, formerly Growth Team Lead at Wistia","The most important thing we've done to improve our user onboarding was to define our activation metric and get serious about tracking the inputs to that metric. Agreeing on what a successfully ""activated"" account looked like, and understanding all the individual actions to get there, allowed us to take our new user onboarding to the next level. We formed a cross-functional team dedicated to increasing that metric. The team is able to clearly prioritize ideas and projects since we all agree what success looks like. That activation metric is paying huge dividends to our users and our company."
52,DA,"Julie Supan, Founder and CEO of Supan Group",There’s more objectivity in one customer sharing their passion and love for a product with another than there is in ads or promotion. It allows the company to spend less to achieve lasting growth.
53,DA,"Chris Savage, CEO of Wistia","You can’t run a business today without data. But you also can’t let the numbers drive the car. No matter how big your company is or how far along you are, there’s an art to company-building that won’t fit in any spreadsheet."
54,DA,"Brian Balfour, Founder and CEO of Reforge, Former VP of Growth at Hubspot","As you gain fresh insight from your data, it opens the door to new questions. As you have new questions, you need to update your instrumentation and analysis. Saying the process is done is saying you understand everything there is to know about your users, product, and channels."
55,DA,"Matin Movassate, Founder and CEO at Heap Analytics","Analytics software is uniquely leveraged. Most software can optimize existing processes, but analytics (done right) should generate insights that bring to life whole new initiatives. It should change what you do, not just how you do it."
56,DA,"Hiten Shah, Co-Founder and CEO of FYI, Founder of Crazy Egg, KISSmetrics and Quick Sprout","If you pick the right metrics for success, you will be able to significantly improve the focus of the whole team and thus improve your business. Developing these metrics should be done first by making hypotheses about your business and validating / invalidating these hypotheses. From there you will have a good base understanding that will allow you to determine what metrics to focus on and how to define success for your business."
57,DA,"Carly Fiorina, Politician and Former CEO of HP","The goal is to turn data into information, and information into insight."
58,DA,"Ben Porterfield, Founder and VP of Engineering at Looker","You want everyone to be able to look at the data and make sense out of it. It should be a value everyone has at your company, especially people interfacing directly with customers. There shouldn’t be any silos where engineers translate the data before handing it over to sales or customer service. That wastes precious time."
59,DA,"Eoghan McCabe, Chairman and Co-Founder at Intercom","We’ve tried to put passion and art and love and creativity ahead of revenue and valuation and buzz and traction, discovering that the latter can often follow the former."
60,DA,"Stewart Butterfield, CEO and Founder of Slack, and previous co-founder of Flickr","Of course hard numbers tell an important story; user stats and sales numbers will always be key metrics. But every day, your users are sharing a huge amount of qualitative data, too — and a lot of companies either don't know how or forget to act on it."
61,DA,"Leo Widrich, Consultant and Co-Founder and COO at Buffer","We live in a time where data is all around us, and there’s a lot of great advice to show us how to make better use of data. However, I’ve found that in some cases this can be a huge waste of time, especially early on with your startup. Replace some of your current focus on quantitative data to qualitative data)."
62,DA,"Jackson Noel, Cofounder and CEO of Appcues","The single most important thing we've done for onboarding is planning past the first session. Let's say you have a SaaS application and know that new users who take actions X, Y, and Z end up being really successful."
63,DA,"Brian Chesky, CEO and Co-founder of Airbnb","The problem with Silicon Valley is when you build an app you are expected to make the app go viral and reach millions of people. This is the worst way to think about it — it’s much better to get 100 people to love you. There was no way we could get 1M people on Airbnb, but we could get 100 people to love us. This is when we decided to do things that wouldn’t scale. Getting 100 people to love you is hard — getting people to like you is much easier than getting people to love you."
64,DA,"Kevin Systrom, Co-founder and former CEO of Instagram","I learned a lesson from watching other companies who held onto things too long. If you look at the history of companies that have succeeded and the ones that have failed, there’s a pretty clear pattern that the ones that have succeeded typically morph every couple of years into something new. And that change is fairly uncomfortable."
65,DA,"David Barrett, Founder and CEO of Expensify","[For early-stage startups,] data is never there when you need it most. At best, data can help you make very small, incremental decisions. But if you’re a startup, you’re focused on big, broad swings — and data has no place in that. You don’t have enough users to draw any meaningful conclusions, and even if you did those users aren’t necessarily representative of your long term target audience. You’ve got data, sure. But not enough to make a genuine, data-driven decision, and pretending otherwise is a recipe for disaster."
66,DA,"Mitch Lowe, CEO of MoviePass and Co-founder of Netflix",Use analytics to make decisions. I always thought you needed a clear answer before you made a decision and the thing that he taught me was [that] you’ve got to use analytics directionally…and never worry whether they are 100% sure. Just try to get them to point you in the right direction.
67,DA,"Lloyd Tabb, Founder, CTO at Looker",Your metrics influence each other. You need to monitor how. Don’t just measure which clicks generate orders. Back it up and break it down. Follow users from their very first point of contact with you to their behavior on your site and the actual transaction. You have to make the linkage all the way through.
68,DA,"Paul Graham, Co-Founder at Y Combinator","Churn, metrics, growth, and conversions are just some of the things that we've got on the record from VCs."
69,DA,"Jessica Livingston, Co-Founder at Y combinator","Merely measuring something has an uncanny tendency to improve it. If you want to make your user numbers go up, put a big piece of paper on your wall and everyday plot the number of users. You'll be delighted when it goes up and disappointed when it goes down. Pretty soon you'll start noticing what makes the number go up, and you'll start to do more of that. Corollary: be careful what you measure."
70,DA,"Peter Levine, VC and General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz",Your users are your guidepost. And the way you stay on the right path in the early stages of a startup is to build stuff and talk to users. And nothing else.
71,DA,"Arjun Sethi, Co-founder at Tribe Capital","For predictive analytics, we need an infrastructure that’s much more responsive to human-scale interactivity: What’s happening today that may influence what happens tomorrow? A lot of iteration needs to occur on a continual basis for the system to get smart, for the machine to learn — explore the data, visualize it, build a model, ask a question, an answer comes back, bring in other data, and repeat the process. The more real-time and granular we can get, the more responsive, and more competitive, we can be."
72,DA,"Ben Horowitz, Co-founder and General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz",You must constantly try to disrupt yourself. The most successful companies embrace cannibalization at the core. [...]You need to innovate and be willing to threaten the core of your business in order to survive. Or you'll die!
73,DA,"Jason Lemkin, Founder, Trusted Advisor at SaaStr Fund","I often see teams that maniacally focus on their metrics around customer acquisition and retention. This usually works well for customer acquisition, but not so well for retention. Why? For many products, metrics often describe the customer acquisition goal in enough detail to provide sufficient management guidance. In contrast, the metrics for customer retention do not provide enough color to be a complete management tool. As a result, many young companies overemphasize retention metrics and do not spend enough time going deep enough on the actual user experience. This generally results in a frantic numbers chase that does not end in a great product."
74,DA,"Bill Gurley, VC General Partner at Benchmark","Don’t obsess over these sub metrics, but obsess over the key metrics that tie into your revenue growth. Everything can be measured, including engineering, PR, product and marketing. If you have your engineering team agree to measure the output of features quarter over quarter, you will get more features built. It’s just a fact. You have to measure every functional area. Measure them all and have everyone agree to the same growth goals to support your revenue, and magical things will happen."
75,DA,"Cindy Alvarez, Principal Group Product Manager at Microsoft and Author","If an Internet company could obsess about only one metric, it should be conversion. No other metric so holistically captures as many critical aspects of a web site – user design, usability, performance, convenience, ad effectiveness, net promoter score, customer satisfaction – all in a single measurement. Yet despite the remarkable power of this metric, it is alarming how few companies today truly understand conversion and how to optimize it. As such, it is time to pound the table again – conversion is by far the most powerful Internet metric of all."
76,DA,"Jonathan Hsu, CFO and COO at AppNexus & Head of Data Science at Social Capital","You don’t need to learn what customers say they want; you need to learn how customers behave and what they need. In other words, focus on their problem, not their suggested solution."
77,DA,"Charles Babbage, Mathematician","Data isn’t useful without the product context. Conversely, having only product context is not very useful without objective metrics..."
78,DA,"Michael O'Connell, Chief Analytics Officer at TIBCO",Errors using inadequate data are much less than those using no data at all.
79,DA,"Edward Tufte, Statistician","When you are dealing with a torrent of data, being able to construct different levels of aggregation is really important, because you want to make sure you’ve used your software intelligently with respect to that large amount of data, and bring to bear the contextual data you need to answer the question at the level of aggregation that you need to answer it."
80,DA,"Chip & Dan Heath, Authors of Made to Stick, Switch","If statistics are boring, you've got the wrong numbers"
81,DA,"Avinash Kaushik, Entrepreneur, Author and Public Speaker",Data are just summaries of thousands of stories – tell a few of those stories to help make the data meaningful.
82,DA,"Marli Mesibov, VP of content strategy at Mad*Pow","[A data-first strategy] is the quest to implement systems (usually massive) to collect data of all shapes and manners before all else. [...]It is being hyper-conservative when it comes to creativity and experimentation because of quant-issues. It is represented by 90% of the data budget invested in Agencies and Consultants driving implementation and re-implementation and hyper-customization of the code. It is represented by the act of creating crazy data thresholds for any initiative to get off the ground. [...]  Data is important. I believe it can help drive your business strategy smartly. But, a data-first strategy, defined as above, is nuts. It will only slow down your progress and allow your competitors to crush you like a bug (even if you are a top player in your market today!).You can have data without information, but you cannot have information without data."
83,DA,"Daniel Gruhl, IBM researcher","A screen full of analytics data looks like a secret code, and in a way it is. That data has a lot of information in it, and it’s impossible to make sense of it without the key. Put another way, data can give answers, but only if you ask the right questions."""
84,DA,"Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee, Computer Scientist, Inventor of World Wide Web","The key is to let computers do what they are good at, which is trawling these massive data sets for something that is mathematically odd, and that makes it easier for humans to do what they are good at — explain those anomalies."
85,DA,"Fiona Roddis, Project Support at Jump Digital Ltd.",Data is a precious thing and will last longer than the systems themselves.
86,DA,"Jeff Allen, SrDirector of Product Marketing for Adobe Analytics","In a marketing analytics worldview, companies must have an accounting of and insight into all of their marketing programs in all of their channels, including web/browser, mobile apps, TV/video, social, paid media, field, print, outdoor and others. If your organization is still stuck in the web analytics mindset, it is time to reinvent your analytics practice, leveraging all of the available marketing analytics tools to make faster and better decisions and drive your business."
87,DA,"Jeff Sauer, Founder Jeffalytics, Digital Marketing Speaker, Professor and Consultant","For every $20 you spend on web analytics tools, you should spend $80 on the brains to make sense of the data."
88,DA,"Tom Conrad, Board Member at Sonos, formerly CTO at Pandora",As a publicly-traded company you have to do a lot of long-term planning with respect to revenue. You have to become more predictable for investors. And revenue is tied to products that have to ship to meet projections.
89,DA,"Julie Zhuo, Co-Founder at Inspirit, formerly VP of Product Design at Facebook","Data and A/B test are valuable allies, and they help us understand and grow and optimize, but they’re not a replacement for clear-headed, strong decision-making. Don’t become dependent on their allure. Sometimes, a little instinct goes a long way."
90,DA,"Monica Rogati, Data Science Advisor, Former VP of Data at Jawbone","The only thing that matters is getting to product/market fit. Product/market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market. You can always feel when product/market fit isn’t happening. The customers aren’t quite getting value out of the product, word of mouth isn’t spreading, usage isn’t growing that fast, press reviews are kind of blah, the sales cycle takes too long, and lots of deals never close. And you can always feel product/market fit when it’s happening. The customers are buying the product just as fast as you can make it— or usage is growing just as fast as you can add more servers."
91,DA,"Mark Andreessen, Cofounder and General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz","A big theme that I keep coming back to is, where is the love? It’s basically just finding out which users are passionate about the product. What is the use case on the product that those people have? Why do they actually love the product? And that gives you a good core of information to guide every part of your business. So messaging, you want to reflect that, but also, now that you know that, you want to make sure that you can really get a lot more people to that particular type of use case and that particular type of gratifying experience. So understanding user gratification is really critical in all of it."
92,DA,"Sean Ellis, Co-creator at GoPractice and CEO and Founder at GrowthHackers","In my time as a product manager, I was constantly reminding myself to talk to customers more. It might have been to talk about existing features, something under development, or customer pain and processes for product research. It was easy in the beginning, because we knew most of the people using the tool as we worked on the initial version. Even as we got bigger, my feelings usually boiled down to these four words: talk to customers more. I think a critical skill, however, is learning how to talk to the right customers."
